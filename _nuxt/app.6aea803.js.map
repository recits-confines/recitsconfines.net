It's now been adopted by several other Android\n// applications. This JavaScript port was written to provide a quick\n// way to demonstrate Rebound animations on the web for a\n// [conference talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5kNm-DgyjY). Since then\n// the JavaScript version has been used to build some really nice interfaces.\n// Check out [brandonwalkin.com](http://brandonwalkin.com) for an\n// example.\n//\n// Overview\n// --------\n// The Library provides a SpringSystem for maintaining a set of Spring\n// objects and iterating those Springs through a physics solver loop\n// until equilibrium is achieved. The Spring class is the basic\n// animation driver provided by Rebound. By attaching a listener to\n// a Spring, you can observe its motion. The observer function is\n// notified of position changes on the spring as it solves for\n// equilibrium. These position updates can be mapped to an animation\n// range to drive animated property updates on your user interface\n// elements (translation, rotation, scale, etc).\n//\n// Example\n// -------\n// Here's a simple example. Pressing and releasing on the logo below\n// will cause it to scale up and down with a springy animation.\n//\n// <div style=\"text-align:center; margin-bottom:50px; margin-top:50px\">\n//   <img\n//     src=\"http://facebook.github.io/rebound/images/rebound.png\"\n//     id=\"logo\"\n//   />\n// </div>\n// <script src=\"../rebound.min.js\"></script>\n// <script>\n//\n// function scale(el, val) {\n//   el.style.mozTransform =\n//   el.style.msTransform =\n//   el.style.webkitTransform =\n//   el.style.transform = 'scale3d(' + val + ', ' + val + ', 1)';\n// }\n// var el = document.getElementById('logo');\n//\n// var springSystem = new rebound.SpringSystem();\n// var spring = springSystem.createSpring(50, 3);\n// spring.addListener({\n//   onSpringUpdate: function(spring) {\n//     var val = spring.getCurrentValue();\n//     val = rebound.MathUtil.mapValueInRange(val, 0, 1, 1, 0.5);\n//     scale(el, val);\n//   }\n// });\n//\n// el.addEventListener('mousedown', function() {\n//   spring.setEndValue(1);\n// });\n//\n// el.addEventListener('mouseout', function() {\n//   spring.setEndValue(0);\n// });\n//\n// el.addEventListener('mouseup', function() {\n//   spring.setEndValue(0);\n// });\n//\n// </script>\n//\n// Here's how it works.\n//\n// ```\n// // Get a reference to the logo element.\n// var el = document.getElementById('logo');\n//\n// // create a SpringSystem and a Spring with a bouncy config.\n// var springSystem = new rebound.SpringSystem();\n// var spring = springSystem.createSpring(50, 3);\n//\n// // Add a listener to the spring.
